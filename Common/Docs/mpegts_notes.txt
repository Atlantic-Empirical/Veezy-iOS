RTSP Video Encoding on iOS

Reads the generated MP4 file on realtime, using some hacks to "guess" the file trailer before it's written. Works with video only, no audio.

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Draft

"Transport Stream segments MUST contain a single MPEG-2 Program. There SHOULD be a Program Association Table (PAT) and a Program Map Table (PMT) at the start of each segment.  A segment that contains video SHOULD have at least one key frame and enough information to completely initialize a video decoder.

A media segment MUST be the continuation of the encoded media at the end of the segment with the previous sequence number, where values in a continuous series, such as timestamps and Continuity Counters, continue uninterrupted - unless the media segment was the first ever to appear in the Playlist file or has an EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag applied to it."
